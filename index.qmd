title: "Fall 2024 - CSC477/CSC2630: Introduction to Mobile Robotics"
---

### Course Overview

This cross-listed course (undergraduate version CSC477H, graduate version CSC2630H) provides an introduction to robotic systems from a computational perspective. A robot is regarded as an intelligent computer that can use sensors and act on the world. We will consider the definitional problems in robotics and look at how they are being solved in practice and by the research community. The emphasis is on algorithms, probabilistic reasoning, optimization, inference mechanisms, and behavior strategies, as opposed to electromechanical systems design. This course aims to help students improve their probabilistic modeling skills and instill the idea that ***a robot that explicitly accounts for its uncertainty works better than a robot that does not.***
