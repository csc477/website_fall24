    "# CSC413 Lab 5: Differential Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will explore how training a neural network with \n",
    "some of the optimization methods discussed in the lecture \n",
    "can cause models to capture more information about the training\n",
    "data than we might intend.\n",
    "We will discuss why this may be problematic from a privacy perspective,\n",
    "and introduce the idea of **differential privacy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, this lab introduces an optimization strategy called\n",
    "**DP-SGD** or differentially private stochastic gradient descent. \n",
    "This strategy has some provable properties about the amount of information\n",
    "captured.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab also serves as an introductory guide to implementing optimization\n",
    "models that are presented in research papers. We hope that the techniques\n",
    "used in this lab build skills so that you can implement new techniques and ideas\n",
    "presented in other papers.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Recognize that typical methods of using SGD to train a neural network might capture too much information about the training data.\n",
    "2. Articulate the importance of privacy to stakeholders.\n",
    "3. Explain the components of the DP-SGD algorithm.\n",
    "4. Compare models trained using SGD and those trained with DP-SGD through the lens of differential privacy.\n",
    "5. Implement, from an algorithm description, optimization techniques like DP-SGD that requires manual gradient manipulation in Pytorch.\n",

Since determining the exact amount requires a very technical calculation, there are software packages which can be used. Here, we use the Opacus software package from Meta research. It provides a function which takes as input the privacy level $\\epsilon$, batchsize and the number of training points, and outputs the variance of the noise. There is another input, i.e., $\\delta$. Do not make any changes to it. If you are interested to know what it means please read the following [lecture note](http://www.gautamkamath.com/CS860notes/lec5.pdf).\n",
