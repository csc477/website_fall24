What is the number of learnable parameters for each of the following transposed convolution layers defined in PyTorch. Try to calculate those by hand first and use pytorch later to verify your results.

(a) `nn.ConvTranspose2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=2, kernel_size=3, stride=1)` 

(b) `nn.ConvTranspose2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=10, kernel_size=3, stride=2)`

(c) `nn.ConvTranspose2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=2, kernel_size=4, stride=5)`

(d) `nn.ConvTranspose2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=4, kernel_size=3, stride=23)`
