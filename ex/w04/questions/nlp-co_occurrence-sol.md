The solution is not unique because we can change the order of the reference entries. In our case we will simply follow the intuitive ordering resulting in the following co-occurence matrix:

| Reference | A   | bird | in  | the | hand | is  | worth | two | bush | 
|       --- | --- | ---  | --- | --- | ---- | --- | ---   | --- | ---  |
| A         | 0   | 1    |   0 |   0 |    0 |   0 |     0 |   0 |    0 |
| bird      | 0   | 0    |   1 |   0 |    0 |   0 |     0 |   0 |    0 |
| in        | 0   | 0    |   0 |   2 |    0 |   0 |     0 |   0 |    0 |
| the       | 0   | 0    |   0 |   0 |    1 |   0 |     0 |   0 |    1 |
| hand      | 0   | 0    |   0 |   0 |    0 |   1 |     0 |   0 |    0 |
| is        | 0   | 0    |   0 |   0 |    0 |   0 |     1 |   0 |    0 |
| worth     | 0   | 0    |   0 |   0 |    0 |   0 |     0 |   1 |    0 |
| two       | 0   | 0    |   0 |   0 |    0 |   0 |     0 |   0 |    0 |
| bush      | 0   | 0    |   0 |   0 |    0 |   0 |     0 |   0 |    0 |
