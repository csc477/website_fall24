Because $\la_1=\la_2$, we will write $\la$ for simplicity. The result is obtained by applying the definition of eigenvalues and distributivity via 
\begin{equation*}
\fA\fu 
  = \fA (\al \fu_1 + \be \fu_2) 
  =   \al \fA \fu_1 + \be \fA \fu_2
  =   \al \la \fu_1 + \be \la \fu_2
  =   \la (\al\fu_1 + \be \fu_2)
  =   \la \fu .
\end{equation*}
