(a) Given a set of vectors $\{\fx_i\}_{i=1}^N$. Show that their empirical mean is equivalent to 
$$\hmu=\argmin_\fmu \sum_i \|\fx_i - \fmu\|^2.$$

(b) There are two equivalent definitons of variance of a random variable. The first one is $\Var(X) := \E[(X - \E[X])^2]$ and the second is $\Var(X) = \E[X^2] - \E[X]^2$. Show that these two definitions actually are equivalent.
