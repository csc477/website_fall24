For a square matrix $\fA$ of size $n \times n$, a vector $\fu_i \neq 0$ which satisÔ¨Åes 
\begin{equation}
\fA\fu_i = \la_i \fu_i
\label{eq:eigen}
\end{equation}
is called a *eigenvector* of $\fA$, and $\la_i$ is the corresponding *eigenvalue*. For a matrix of size $n \times n$, there are $n$ eigenvalues $\la_i$ (which are not necessarily distinct).

Show that if $\fu_1$ and $\fu_2$ are eigenvectors with equal corresponding eigenvalues $\la_1 = \la_2$, then $\fu = \al \fu_1 + \be \fu_2$ is also an eigenvector with the same eigenvalue.
