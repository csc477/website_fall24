Let $\hte$ and $\hte(\ve)$ be as defined in class. Show that the first order Taylor expansion of $\hte(\ve)$ around $\ve=0$ is given by the equation given in class, i.e. by
\begin{align*}
\hat{\theta}({\epsilon}) \approx \hat{\theta} + \epsilon\frac{d\hat{\theta}(\epsilon)}{d\epsilon} {\Bigr |}_{\epsilon=0} .
\end{align*}
