First, we hvae to load the `vgg11` model which is part of torchvision as has been shown in the lecture:

```python
import torchvision
vgg11 = torchvision.models.vgg.vgg11(pretrained=False)
```

The number of parameters for the entire model, is the easier part: We can simply use the `parameters()` iterator which returns the set of parameters for each module. Those can then be counted using the `numel()` method resulting in

```python
sum(p.numel() for p in vgg11.parameters())
```
Obtaining the number of parameters for each of the layer requires looking into the source code of the vgg11 model. All VGG models are ultimately instantiated by using the `VGG` class. Its forward pass looks like this:

```python
x = self.features(x)
x = self.avgpool(x)
x = torch.flatten(x, 1)
x = self.classifier(x)
```

A closer look at the implementation reveals that we can obtain the individual layers parameter by simply iterating over the `self.features` and `self.classifier` modules. The `self.avgpool` module does not have any parameters. The following code snippet shows how to obtain the number of parameters for each layer of the convolutional backbone:

```python
for layer in vgg11.features:
    print(layer, sum(p.numel() for p in layer.parameters()))
```

To get the number of paramers in the cnn head, simply update the code snippet to iterate over `vgg11.classifier` instead of `vgg11.features`.
